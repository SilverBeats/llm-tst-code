Let's say you have a positive review of a store, such as ""Everything I bought from this store was great quality and reasonably priced."" To turn this into a negative review, you could change the wording to: ""Although the prices were relatively good, the quality of the products I bought from this store was not up to par."" This highlights the positive aspect of the price but also mentions the negative aspect of the product quality. Similarly, you could change the wording to ""The prices of the items I bought from this store were too high, considering their low quality."" This emphasizes the negative aspect of the product quality and price while still mentioning that the store itself wasn't bad.",0
