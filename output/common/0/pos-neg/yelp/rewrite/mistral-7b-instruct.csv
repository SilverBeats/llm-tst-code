In this case, ""great"" becomes ""not great"" and ""love"" becomes ""don't love"". Additionally, we replace positive words with their negated forms (e.g., ""not"" instead of ""good"" and ""love"" instead of ""have""). This can be done with any combination of words and phrases in a given sentence.",0
